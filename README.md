## Overview
This repository contains the code and assets related to my completion of the Power BI simulation offered by PwC Switzerland through Forage. The simulation focused on enhancing skills related to data visualization, defining key performance indicators (KPIs) for gender balance and diversity, and understanding the imperatives of diversity and inclusion in the corporate world.

## Simulation Tasks
1. **Defining KPIs for Gender Balance and Diversity:**
   - Identified and defined key performance indicators (KPIs) related to gender balance and diversity in the workplace.
