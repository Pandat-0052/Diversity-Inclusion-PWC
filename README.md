## Overview
This repository contains the code and assets related to my completion of the Power BI simulation offered by PwC Switzerland through Forage. The simulation focused on enhancing skills related to data visualization, defining key performance indicators (KPIs) for gender balance and diversity, and understanding the imperatives of diversity and inclusion in the corporate world.

## Simulation Tasks
1. **Defining KPIs for Gender Balance and Diversity:**
   - Identified and defined key performance indicators (KPIs) related to gender balance and diversity in the workplace.
   - Utilized analytical skills to uncover insights and root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level.

2. **Creating Effective Visualizations:**
   - Leveraged Power BI to create interactive and insightful visualizations representing HR data effectively.
   - Designed dashboards that conveyed gender-related KPIs and insights in a visually compelling manner.

3. **Understanding Diversity and Inclusion Imperatives:**
   - Explored the importance of diversity and inclusion in the corporate world.
   - Recognized the role of data-driven decision-making in fostering equity and inclusivity within organizations.
